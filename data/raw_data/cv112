1. MicroService development: 
Currently working under team to develop simple REST based Micro service for current project using Docker technology. The aim is to build simple Micro Service using Spring Boot which will be hosted on docker container. 
 
2. Logs Based Analytics 
Developed simple GUI based analytics application for own application which probably will be used in End to End. The front end was developed using Bootstrap, JQuery and React JS. On server side Spring 4 was used. The aim behind developing application was need from client for central portal where client can get current status of his order and he will get to know where order is being stuck. The results are generated from fetching logs directly from server and parsing them according to user's input. Additional to that REST based simple web service was also implemented for interacting with partner systems. 
 
3. Decision Making Implementation for orders: 
For service orders to be route through automated system and not by legacy system, requirement came for development of decision based admin portal where admin can go and configure gates (decides flow) 
With this implementation client order will be routed to automated flow throughout Sales, order handoff, 
Provisioning, Service delivery and Billing. Abstract Factory based design pattern was used to 
Implement this project
