RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
A flow-based programming language for Multi-core architecture
January 2010 - Till Date
Masters Thesis (Work in Progress)
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Dr.  R.K.Ghosh & Prof.  Harish Karnick
•
Description:
The thesis project is aimed at the design & development of a new shared-memory parallel pro-
gramming language for the current and future generations of many-core machines.
A  programmer  expresses  problems  inherently  as  an  acyclic  sequence  of  computations  resulting  in  the
formation of a computation DAG. A DAG diffusion model explicitly exposes the available parallelism at runtime.
Recursive architecturing
& other proposed constructs achieve the construction rapidly & elegantly. A combination
of Cilk style programming, flow based execution and
promise
based approach is undertaken.  The programmer
works with persistent stateful entities in a 2D space, whose structure is dynamic and which registers the results
to  the  outside  world  as
signals
.   The  multi-phase  processing  approach  couples  non-deterministic  construction
with deterministic outcomes.  The language looks promising for graph-based and non-deterministic problems.
Other flow-based problems are being studied.  The work is still under progress.
Cholesky Factorization for Parallel Architectures
July 2010 - November 2010
CS738:  Advanced Compiler Optimization
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Prof.  Sanjeev K. Aggarwal
•
Description:
The project aimed to exploit the innate parallelism available in the algorithm for Cholesky Fac-
torization of a symmetric positive-definite matrix to achieve higher speedups.  A blocked algorithm as available
in LAPACK has been implemented using Level-3 basic linear algebra operations in square blocked pack (SBP)
format & optimized using compiler optimization techniques.  The performance was compared on multiple hard-
wares using CUDA (GPGPU) & Intel TBB (2,4,16,24 core).  Results show that parallelizing a blocked algorithm
has no significant benefits over parallelizing the corresponding naıve sequential version.
A new digital watermarking scheme for 3D triangular mesh models
December 2009 - May 2010
CS698E: Digital Watermarking & Steganography
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Prof.  Phalguni Gupta
•
Description:
The  project  was  targeted  to  come  up  with  a  reversible  watermark  embedding  scheme  for  3D-
Triangular mesh models.  The final scheme that was designed integrates a reversible watermarking scheme for 2D
Vector data together with a 3D watermarking scheme for mesh-models in a novel fashion resulting in increased
capacity at slight/acceptable visual distortion in terms of PSNR. The approach was to replicate watermarking
sequence into the range images of multiple Voronoi patches of the mesh.
Object Tracking Using SIFT features
June 2009 - Nov 2009
CS676:  Computer Vision & Image Processing
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Dr.  Simant Dubey
•
Description:
The project investigated the accuracy of using Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT) features
as a similarity measure for object tracking of a previously unknown object.  The proposed strategy outperforms
Camshift algorithm & Lucas-Kanade optical flow methods in most scenarios, however certain number of SIFT
features are required to be present.  A Kalman filter was used for Gaussian noise-reduction.
OTHER COURSE PROJECTS
Compiler Design for a subset of C++ language
December 2008 - May 2009
CS335:  Compiler Design
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Prof.  Sanjeev K. Aggarwal
•
Description:
The aim of the project was to develop a compiler for a subset of C++ language.  The final working
compiler could tackle primitive data types, dynamic scoping using hierarchical symbol table structure, pointer
arithmetic, type coercion, loops, conditionals, functions and recursion.
File Compressor & Archiver
December 2008 - May 2009
CS653:  Functional Programming
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Prof.  Piyush P. Kurur
•
Description:
The project implemented adaptive Huffman encoding(Vitter Algorithm), Burrrows-Wheeler trans-
form and LZ encoding schemes in a pipelined way to achieve high compression ratio for files.  The project was
built in the functional language Haskell.  The project stands successfully completed with good compression ratios
and performance.
Comparison of TCP performance over WLAN
December 2009 - May 2010
CS634:  Mobile Computing
Dept.  of CSE, IITK
•
Advisor:
Dr.  R.K.Ghosh
•
Description:
The project compares and studies theoretically the behavior of various TCP protocols over wireless
LAN. Simulations were done for a selected few protocols.  Traffic conditions, packet error rates, transmissions
rates were simulated for some WLAN protocols.  SNOOP protocol was found to be the best performing among
others.
Peer to Peer File sharing Client
July 2008 - November 2008
