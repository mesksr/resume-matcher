Title:
Modeling and Analysis of Topic Diffusion in Social Networks.
Supervisor:
Dr. Amitabha Bagchi, IIT Delhi
Description:   
This  work  is  pr
imarily  concerned  with  modeling 
dynamics  of  topics  spreading  in  a  social  network 
and  analyzing  the 
virality 
of 
topics. We propose a theoretical model to simulate social network dynamics with a continuous stream of exogenous topics compe
ting to enter 
into a
nd diffuse through the network. The model is being tested on a synthetic social network graph that follows the 
Watts & Strogatz (Small 
World)  Graph
Model.  We  apply 
Mean  Field  Theory
concepts  for  analyzing  the  dynamics  of  the  process.  Besides  theoretical  mo
deling,  this 
project involves extensive coding and simulation studies. We used C and Python for coding. We also developed a parallel code 
using MPI library 
to make the simulations faster. We study several metrics of topic diffusion like the 
lifetime, sprea
d of topics, cluster formation & merging 
and
graph modularity
to analyze 
virality
of topics. The interesting fact revealed by our study is  that virality of  topics in this model is achieved as a 
consequence of the network dynamics, we call 
lattice cluster m
erging

Title:
Augmenting & Compressing the 
Farey Table 
and its Applications to Digital Image Processing
Supervisor:
Dr. Partha Bhowmik, IIT Kharagpur
I  did  my  final  year  B.Tech  project  on  the  problem  of  augmenting  &  compressi
ng  the 
Farey  Table 
to  be  used  in  digital  image  processing 
applications.  Our  study  shows  that  the  ranks  of  fractions  in  the  Farey  sequence  can  be  used  to  provide  a  useful  estimation  of
their  relative 
values. We designed a novel algorithm
to efficiently find
the fraction in a Farey sequence 
F
n
closest to a given fraction 
p/q
. We could avoid all 
floating  point  operations  which  made  this  even  more  elegant  and  faster.  It  finds  excellent  applications  in  polygonal  approxim
ation  and  shape 
analysis.
