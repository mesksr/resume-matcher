Organisation 
Velocity measument and Orientation estimation. 
Created a callibration and mesurement routine for measuring Bhabha Atomic Research 
velocity and orientation of projectile at around 300 m/s using Centre 
a high speed camers 60, 000 fps. Earlier the lab took these reading 
manually on camera and used laser obstruction for velocity measurement. 
Local Localization using CV Cluster Innovation Centre 
Implemted a local solution for SLAM using features points from SURF algotihm to invert camera movement and get world co-oridnates using stereoscopy. 
 
Featureless AR (Project Cubicle) 
Using features in images to get camera orientation and project cubical objects Laboratory for Pattern 
in the orientation, testing applications for featureless AR for Project Cubicle Engineering
